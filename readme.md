# Microsoft for OPEN HACK 2018


## Files for hackathon ML 2018

The openhack challenge 2018 was held in Singapore, and in this repository you can find the code snippets solving the specific scenarios of the challenge. 

1. Challenge 1 was on setting up the Azure Environment and spin up a [Deep Learning Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/provision-deep-learning-dsvm)
2. Challenge 2 was on developing a simple image classification model usign Azure Custom Vision Service
3. Challenge 3 was on developing a simple image classification model using Scikit Learn
4. Challenge 4 was on developing a deep learning model that can classify images.
5. Challenge 5 was on deploying the model in challenge 3 or 4 using the Azure Machine Learning Service SDK into a container.
6. Challenge 6 was to use Custom Vision Service for object detection to detect the presence of a helmet in an image.
7. Challenge 7 built on top of the dataset from 6 where a deep learning model needed to built based on Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO. 
8. Challenge 8 was essentially this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection).
